ckanext-datatable
=================

This is CKAN extension works with the WET-BOEW extension for CKAN 
(https://github.com/open-data/ckanext-wet-boew) to implement the 
IPreviewResource interface to use the WET Tables to preview 
resources in the datastore.

Because the CKAN IPreviewResource uses an IFRAME this version is not
suitable for use with the Canadian Open Data portal, but is made 
available for other sites that are based on the WET toolkit.
